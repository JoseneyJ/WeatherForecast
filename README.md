# WeatherForecast | Server-Side APIs | Updated Version

## My Task

Build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. Use Third-party APIs to access data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL

Use the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities. The base URL should look like the following: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}`.



## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

Updates made: 
* Improvements to website layout (HTML & CSS). As well as resizing 5-day forecast card to be unifromed. 
* Improvements to Javascript. Previous website would only allow the search of cites ex. Miami and not Miami, FL. Now this has been corrected.
